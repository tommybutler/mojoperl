.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Pod::Spell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for
spellchecking.  Pod::Spell rather like Pod::Text, except that
it doesn't put much effort into actual formatting, and it suppresses things
that look like Perl symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spellchecking
program won't complain about mystery words like "\f(CW$thing\fR\*(L"
or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR\*(L" or \*(R"hashref").
.PP
This class provides no new public methods.  All methods of interest are
inherited from Pod::Parser (which see).  The especially
interesting ones are \f(CW\*(C`parse_from_filehandle\*(C'\fR (which without arguments
takes from \s-1STDIN\s0 and sends to \s-1STDOUT\s0) and \f(CW\*(C`parse_from_file\*(C'\fR.  But you
can probably just make do with the examples in the synopsis though.
.PP
This class works by filtering out words that look like Perl or any
form of computerese (like "\f(CW$thing\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`N>7\*(C'\fR\*(L" or
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`@{$foo}{\*(Aqbar\*(Aq,\*(Aqbaz\*(Aq}\*(C'\fR", anything in C<...> or F<...>
codes, anything in verbatim paragraphs (code blocks), and anything
in the stopword list.  The default stopword list for a document starts
out from the stopword list defined by Pod::Wordlist,
and can be supplemented (on a per-document basis) by having
\&\f(CW"=for stopwords"\fR / \f(CW"=for :stopwords"\fR region(s) in a document.

.SS "parse_from_filehandle($in_fh,$out_fh)"
.IX Subsection "parse_from_filehandle($in_fh,$out_fh)"
This method takes an input filehandle (which is assumed to already be
opened for reading) and reads the entire input stream looking for blocks
(paragraphs) of \s-1POD\s0 documentation to be processed. If no first argument
is given the default input filehandle \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR is used.
.PP
The \f(CW$in_fh\fR parameter may be any object that provides a \fB\f(BIgetline()\fB\fR
method to retrieve a single line of input text (hence, an appropriate
wrapper object could be used to parse PODs from a single string or an
array of strings).
.SS "parse_from_file($filename,$outfile)"
.IX Subsection "parse_from_file($filename,$outfile)"
This method takes a filename and does the following:
.IP "\(bu" 2
opens the input and output files for reading
(creating the appropriate filehandles)
.IP "\(bu" 2
invokes the \fB\f(BIparse_from_filehandle()\fB\fR method passing it the
corresponding input and output filehandles.
.IP "\(bu" 2
closes the input and output files.
.PP
If the special input filename "\*(L", \*(R"\-\*(L" or \*(R"<&STDIN\*(L" is given then the \s-1STDIN\s0
filehandle is used for input (and no open or close is performed). If no
input filename is specified then \*(R"\-" is implied. Filehandle references,
or objects that support the regular \s-1IO\s0 operations (like \f(CW\*(C`<$fh>\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`$fh\-<Egt\*(C'\fRgetline>) are also accepted; the handles must already be
opened.
.PP
If a second argument is given then it should be the name of the desired
output file. If the special output filename \*(L"\-\*(R" or \*(L">&STDOUT\*(R" is given
then the \s-1STDOUT\s0 filehandle is used for output (and no open or close is
performed). If the special output filename \*(L">&STDERR\*(R" is given then the
\&\s-1STDERR\s0 filehandle is used for output (and no open or close is
performed). If no output filehandle is currently in use and no output
filename is specified, then \*(L"\-\*(R" is implied.
Alternatively, filehandle references or objects that support the regular
\&\s-1IO\s0 operations (like \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, e.g. IO::String) are also accepted;
the object must already be opened.
.SH "ENCODINGS"
.IX Header "ENCODINGS"
Pod::Parser, which Pod::Spell extends, is extremely naive about
character encodings.  The \f(CW\*(C`parse_from_file\*(C'\fR method does not apply
any PerlIO encoding layer.  If your Pod file is encoded in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0
your data will be read incorrectly.
.PP
You should instead use \f(CW\*(C`parse_from_filehandle\*(C'\fR and manage the input
and output layers yourself.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        binmode($_, ":utf8") for ($infile, $outfile);
\&        $my ps = Pod::Spell\->new;
\&        $ps\->parse_from_filehandle( $infile, $outfile );
.Ve
.PP
If your output destination cannot handle \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 you should set your
output handle to Latin\-1 and tell Pod::Spell to strip out words
with wide characters.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        binmode($infile, ":utf8");
\&        binmode($outfile, ":encoding(latin1)");
\&        $my ps = Pod::Spell\->new( no_wide_chars => 1 );
\&        $ps\->parse_from_filehandle( $infile, $outfile );

.SH "ADDING STOPWORDS"
.IX Header "ADDING STOPWORDS"
You can add stopwords on a per-document basis with
\&\f(CW"=for stopwords"\fR / \f(CW"=for :stopwords"\fR regions, like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  =for stopwords  plok Pringe zorch   snik !qux
\&  foo bar baz quux quuux
.Ve
.PP
This adds every word in that paragraph after \*(L"stopwords\*(R" to the
stopword list, effective for the rest of the document.  In such a
list, words are whitespace-separated.  (The amount of whitespace
doesn't matter, as long as there's no blank lines in the middle
of the paragraph.)  Plural forms are added automatically using
Lingua::EN::Inflect. Words beginning with \*(L"!\*(R" are
\&\fIdeleted\fR from the stopword list \*(-- so \*(L"!qux\*(R" deletes \*(L"qux\*(R" from the
stopword list, if it was in there in the first place.  Note that if
a stopword is all-lowercase, then it means that it's okay in \fIany\fR
case; but if the word has any capital letters, then it means that
it's okay \fIonly\fR with \fIthat\fR case.  So a Wordlist entry of \*(L"perl\*(R"
would permit \*(L"perl\*(R", \*(L"Perl\*(R", and (less interestingly) \*(L"\s-1PERL\*(R",\s0 \*(L"pERL\*(R",
\&\*(L"PerL\*(R", et cetera.  However, a Wordlist entry of \*(L"Perl\*(R" catches
only \*(L"Perl\*(R", not \*(L"perl\*(R".  So if you wanted to make sure you said
only \*(L"Perl\*(R", never \*(L"perl\*(R", you could add this to the top of your
document:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  =for stopwords !perl Perl
.Ve
.PP
Then all instances of the word \*(L"Perl\*(R" would be weeded out of the
Pod::Spell\-formatted version of your document, but any instances of
the word \*(L"perl\*(R" would be left in (unless they were in a C<...> or
F<...> style).
.PP
You can have several \*(L"=for stopwords\*(R" regions in your document.  You
can even express them like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  =begin stopwords
\&
\&  plok Pringe zorch
\&
\&  snik !qux
\&
\&  foo bar
\&  baz quux quuux
\&
\&  =end stopwords
.Ve
.PP
If you want to use E<...> sequences in a \*(L"stopwords\*(R" region, you
have to use \*(L":stopwords\*(R", as here:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  =for :stopwords
\&  virtE<ugrave>
.Ve
.PP
\&...meaning that you're adding a stopword of \*(L"virtù\*(R".  If
you left the \*(L":\*(R" out, that would mean you were adding a stopword of
\&\*(L"virtE<ugrave>\*(R" (with a literal E, a literal <, etc), which
will have no effect, since  any occurrences of virtE<ugrave>
don't look like a normal human-language word anyway, and so would
be screened out before the stopword list is consulted anyway.
.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"

.SS "finding the wordlist"
.IX Subsection "finding the wordlist"
Pod::Spell uses File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir if you're getting errors
about the wordlist being missing, chances are it's a problem with its
heuristics. Set \f(CW\*(C`PATH_ISDEV_DEBUG=1\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`PATH_FINDDEV_DEBUG=1\*(C'\fR, or both in
your environment for debugging, and then file a bug with
File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir if necessary.
.SH "HINT"
.IX Header "HINT"
If you feed output of Pod::Spell into your word processor and run a
spell-check, make sure you're \fInot\fR also running a grammar-check \*(-- because
Pod::Spell drops words that it thinks are Perl symbols, jargon, or
stopwords, this means you'll have ungrammatical sentences, what with
words being missing and all.  And you don't need a grammar checker
to tell you that.
