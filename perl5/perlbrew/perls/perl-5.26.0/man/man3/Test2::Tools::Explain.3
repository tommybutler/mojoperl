.SH "NAME"
Test2::Tools::Explain \-\- Explain tools for Perl's Test2 framework
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
Version 0.02
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
Test2::Suite dropped the \f(CW\*(C`explain()\*(C'\fR function that had been
part of Test::More.  For those who miss it in Test2, you can use
Test2::Tools::Explain.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Test2::Tools::Explain;
\&
\&    my $errors = fleeble_the_whatzit();
\&    is( $errors, [], \*(AqShould have no errors from fleebling\*(Aq ) or diag explain( $errors );

.SH "EXPORTS"
.IX Header "EXPORTS"
All functions in this module are exported by default.
.SH "SUBROUTINES"
.IX Header "SUBROUTINES"
.ie n .SS "explain( @things_to_explain )"
.el .SS "explain( \f(CW@things_to_explain\fP )"
.IX Subsection "explain( @things_to_explain )"
Will convert the contents of any references in a human readable format,
and return them as strings.  Usually you want to pass this into \f(CW\*(C`note\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`diag\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Handy for things like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    is( $errors, [], \*(AqShould have no errors\*(Aq ) or diag explain( $errors );
.Ve
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`explain\*(C'\fR does \s-1NOT\s0 output anything.

Schwern, who took it from \f(CW\*(C`Test::Most\*(C'\fR by Curtis Poe.
